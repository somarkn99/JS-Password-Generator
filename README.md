# JS-Password-Generator
It enables you to generate your own passwords with different degrees of power and security and adjust them to the length, characters, etc. You can include it in your website very easily, where no outside libraries have been used. Only Java Script.

I hope it's useful to you in your work, and I'm going to constantly improve its coordination and add new features to it.
